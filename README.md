*Tetris made with DirectX*  
*This is an old project from 2022 and does not represent how I code today*

## Description

Game built on top of the Chilli Framework, based on DirectX. Provides access to the window pixel buffer.  

I did not benefit from any drawing libraries and had to do all rendering methods myself. I also used the Windows API to read `.bmp` files.  

Other than that, it's just Tetris with a stolen background from the internet.
